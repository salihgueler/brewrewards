# BrewRewards Multi-Tenant Implementation with AWS

This document outlines the implementation of the Transactions API and related components for the BrewRewards multi-tenant application, as implemented with the help of Amazon Q.

## Transactions API Implementation

The Transactions API was implemented to support the multi-tenant architecture of BrewRewards, allowing:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Each coffee shop (tenant) can only access their own transaction data
2. **Cross-Tenant Customer Experience**: Customers can view their transactions across multiple shops
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles have appropriate access levels

### Key Components Implemented

1. **DynamoDB Table**:
   - Added TransactionsTable with proper partition key strategy
   - Created GSIs for efficient querying by user and shop

2. **GraphQL Schema**:
   - Added Transaction type and related input types
   - Implemented queries for listing transactions by shop and by user
   - Added mutation for creating transactions

3. **API Routes**:
   - Implemented `/api/shops/[shopId]/transactions` for shop-specific transactions
   - Implemented `/api/users/transactions` for cross-shop user transactions

4. **React Hooks**:
   - Created `useTransactions` hook for shop admins
   - Created `useUserTransactions` hook for customers
   - Implemented `useCreateTransaction` for creating new transactions

5. **UI Components**:
   - Built `TransactionsList` component for displaying transactions
   - Created `CreateTransactionForm` for recording new transactions

6. **Admin Pages**:
   - Added transaction management to Shop Admin dashboard
   - Implemented cross-tenant transaction view for Super Admin
   - Created customer transaction history page

7. **Demo Data**:
   - Created script to generate realistic multi-tenant test data
   - Implemented presentation test script for demonstrating tenant isolation

## Multi-Tenant Best Practices Implemented

1. **Data Isolation**:
   - Used composite keys in DynamoDB (PK: shopId, SK: transactionId)
   - Added GSIs for efficient cross-tenant queries

2. **Authorization**:
   - Implemented tenant-aware authorization checks
   - Ensured shop admins can only access their own shop's data
   - Allowed super admins to access all tenant data
   - Restricted customers to viewing only their own transactions

3. **User Experience**:
   - Created unified customer dashboard showing activity across shops
   - Implemented shop-specific views for admins

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Staff Management implementation
2. Enhance analytics dashboards with transaction data
3. Implement additional tenant isolation testing

This implementation demonstrates the key principles of multi-tenant architecture on AWS, showing how to maintain proper data isolation while providing a seamless experience for users who interact with multiple tenants.
